    "We can break down the supervised learning paradigm with six major concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Items where we want to predict something. We denote observations with ***x***. We sometimes can also denote it as ***inputs*** . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Targets**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Targets are labels corresoinding to an observation. These are usually the things being predictd. The standard notation for them us ***y*** or ***ground truth***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model is a mathematical expression or a function that takes a observation, ***x*** , and predicts the target value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    " \n",
    "- Sometimes we call them ***weights***, these parameterize the model. It is standard to use notation ***w*** (for weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictions***\n",
    "\n",
    "- So called ***estimates***, these are the values if the targets guessed by the model, given the observations. We denote them using a hat notation. So we would call them ***y hat***. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A loss function is a function that compares how far off a predicition is from a target for observations in a training set. Given a tartget and its precitions, the loss function assigns a scalar, or just one value which we call the loss. The lower the value, the better the model is. We use L to denote the loss function. \n",
